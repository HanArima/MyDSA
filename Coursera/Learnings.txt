Building a Source file using VS code means compiling the file using a compiler. After building an executable file is created with '.exe'        extension. 
It was bothering me a lot because the source code and the executable file was in the same directory. 
Using settings and 'Exclude file'I excluded the .exe file by adding it using 'add pattern'
